What is plasma?Plasma is also called the “fourth state of matter”. Solid is heated to became a liquid, liquid is heated to became a gas.Upon further heating, the gas is ionized into a plasma. Since plasma usually exists only in a vacuum, we need to pump the air out of a vacuum chamber in the laboratory. The Definition of Plasma A plasma is a quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles which exhibits collective behavior. The Saha Equation\\frac{n_i}{n_n}\\approx2.4\\times10^{21}\\frac{T^{3/2}}{n_i}e^{-U_i/KT}n_i\\ is\\ the\\ density\\ of\\ ionized\\ atomsn_n\\ is\\ the\\ density\\ of\\ neutral\\ atomsK\\ is\\ Boltzmann's\\ constantU_i\\ is\\ the\\ ionization\\ energy\\ of\\ the\\ gasPhysical meaning When temperature is raising, the whole value is increasing exponentially with U_i/KT. The lower value of n_i, the lower recombination rate of ionized atoms. Reference Book: Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion by Francis F.
