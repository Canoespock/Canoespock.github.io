What is plasma?Plasma is also called the “fourth state of matter”. Solid is heated to become a liquid, liquid is heated to become a gas.Upon further heating, the gas is ionized into a plasma. Since plasma usually exists only in a vacuum, we need to pump the air out of a vacuum chamber in the laboratory. The Definition of Plasma A plasma is a quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles which exhibits collective behavior. The Coulomb force between A and B diminishes as 1/r^2. However, for a given solid angle($\\Delta$r/r = constant), the volume of plasma in B that can affect A increases as r^3. The Saha Equation\\frac{n_i}{n_n}\\approx2.4\\times10^{21}\\frac{T^{3/2}}{n_i}e^{-U_i/KT}n_i\\ is\\ the\\ density\\ of\\ ionized\\ atomsn_n\\ is\\ the\\ density\\ of\\ neutral\\ atomsK\\ is\\ Boltzmann's\\ constantU_i\\ is\\ the\\ ionization\\ energy\\ of\\ the\\ gasPhysical meaning When temperature is raising, the whole value is increasing exponentially with U_i/KT. The higher value of n_i, the lower recombination rate of ionized atoms.
